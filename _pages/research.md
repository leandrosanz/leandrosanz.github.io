## Job Market Paper

**Supply Network Fragility, Inventory Investment, and Corporate Liquidity** <br />
<br /> 
<span style="font-size:0.8em;">**Abstract:** Using new data on more than 11,000 foreign suppliers of U.S. manufacturing companies from 2007 to 2021, I show that supply network fragility has important implications for corporate policies. Firms with fragile supply networks tend to have less cash, higher book leverage, and larger input inventories than otherwise similar firms. Moreover, the evolution of corporate policies around supply network shocks and exogenous variation in supply network fragility due to technological breakthroughs that increase reliance on advanced electronics suggests that supply network fragility leads firms to choose less liquidity to finance inventory buildup. I propose that corporate liquidity is less advantageous for firms with fragile supply networks because such firms are less likely to have access to spot markets for specialized inputs after disruptions. Overall, these findings suggest that supply network risk has important firm-level implications beyond the direct transmission of shocks from suppliers to customer firms.</span>

## Working Papers

1. [The Unicorn Puzzle](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4255165) <br />
with Daria Davydova, Rüdiger Fahlenbrach, and René Stulz<br><br>
<span style="font-size:0.8em;">**Abstract:** From 2010 to 2021, 639 US VC-funded firms achieved unicorn status. We investigate why there are so many unicorns and why founders grant investors privileges to obtain unicorn status. Unicorns rely more than other VC-funded startups on organizational capital and network effects. Unicorn status enables startups to access new sources of capital, and growth in available funding causes the number of unicorns to increase. As a result, unicorns can stay private longer, which enables them to grow their organizational intangible assets with less expropriation risk and better capture the economies of scale on which their business model relies.</span>

2. [Economic Policy Uncertainty and Multinational Companies](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4060441) <br />
with Leming Lin and Atanas Mihov<br><br>
<span style="font-size:0.8em;">**Abstract:** We study the impact and propagation of economic policy uncertainty (EPU) via subsidiary networks of U.S. multinational corporations (MNCs). We find that increases in host-country EPU lead to significant decreases in MNC valuations. We document heterogeneous effects across important firm- and country-level dimensions such as intangible capital intensity, financial constraints, and country institutional quality. Higher EPU in host countries is associated with a decline in the growth of local MNC subsidiary assets and employment. We find no significant average spillover effects of host-country EPU on MNC subsidiaries in other countries and some evidence of negative spillover effects among vertically linked subsidiaries.</span>

1. [Property Rights Institutions, Foreign Investment, and the Valuation of Multinational Firms](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X19300558) <br />
with Leming Lin, Atanas Mihov, and Detelina Stoyanova, Journal of Financial Economics, 2019, 134 (1): 214-235.<br><br>
<span style="font-size:0.8em;">**Abstract:** We study the effect of property rights institutions in host countries, the institutions protecting investors from expropriation by host country agents, on the geographic structure and valuation of US multinational corporations (MNCs). We provide firm-level evidence that better property rights attract investment from MNCs. We disentangle the effects of the Stulz (2005) “twin agency problems” in the context of foreign direct investment and show that our results are not driven by legal institutions protecting investors from expropriation by corporate insiders. Further, we show that changes in the quality of property rights in locations where MNCs operate have material impact on MNCs’ valuations.</span>

with Atanas Mihov and W. Scott Frame, Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, 2020, 55 (3): 955-988.<br><br>
<span style="font-size:0.8em;">**Abstract:** This study investigates the implications of cross-country differences in banking regulation and supervision for the international subsidiary locations and risk of U.S. bank holding companies (BHCs). We find that BHCs are more likely to operate subsidiaries in countries with weaker regulation and supervision and that such location decisions are associated with elevated BHC risk and higher contribution to systemic risk. The quality of BHCs’ internal controls and risk management plays an important role in these location choices and risk outcomes. Overall, our study suggests that U.S. banking organizations engage in cross-country regulatory arbitrage, with potentially adverse consequences.</span>

3. [Global Banks and Systemic Risk: The Dark Side of Country Financial Connectedness](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261560622001371) <br />
with Atanas Mihov and Ping McLemore, Journal of International Money and Finance, 2022, 129: 102734. <br><br>
<span style="font-size:0.8em;">**Abstract:** We study the relation between country financial connectedness and systemic risk for U.S. banking organizations with global exposures. Using supervisory data on U.S. banks’ foreign claims, we find that banks with exposure to countries with globally connected financial markets contribute more to U.S. systemic risk. These adverse effects are amplified by systemically important and less capitalized banking organizations. Consistent with the idea that financial connectedness is a conduit for risk transmission, risk spillovers to the U.S. from foreign financial crises are magnified when the countries in crisis are well financially connected. Our findings are relevant for macro-prudential policy given the concentration of U.S. financial claims in well-connected markets. </span>

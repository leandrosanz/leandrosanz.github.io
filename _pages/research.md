## Working Papers
1. Global Banks and Systemic Risk: The Dark Side of Country Financial Connectedness <br />
with Atanas Mihov and Ping McLemore<br><br>
<span style="font-size:0.8em;">**Abstract:** We study the relation between country financial connectedness and systemic risk for U.S. banking organizations with global exposures. We find that banks with more foreign claims in countries that are well connected to global financial markets contribute more to U.S. systemic risk. We document specific bank-level (systemic importance, leverage, and illiquidity) and country-level (financial crises) channels that amplify these effects. We also document the roles different forms of connectedness, and types and sectors of foreign claims, play for cross-border risk propagation. Our findings are particularly relevant for macro-prudential policy given the concentration of U.S. financial claims in well-connected markets.</span>

2. Economic Policy Uncertainty and Multinational Companies <br />
with Leming Lin and Atanas Mihov<br><br>
<span style="font-size:0.8em;">**Abstract:** We study the effect of economic policy uncertainty (EPU) in host countries on the valuation and geographic structure of U.S. multinational corporations (MNCs). We find that increases in host-country EPU are associated with decreases in MNC valuations. The negative effects of EPU are exacerbated by MNCs' capital intensity and financial constraints. Higher EPU in host countries is associated with slower asset and employment growth of existing subsidiaries, and also a decline in subsidiary revenue and profitability. An increase in a host country's EPU also leads to MNC entry in new markets, but has no significant effect on the growth of existing subsidiaries located elsewhere.</span>

## Publications
1. [Property Rights Institutions, Foreign Investment, and the Valuation of Multinational Firms](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X19300558) <br />
with Leming Lin, Atanas Mihov, and Detelina Stoyanova, Journal of Financial Economics, (2019) 134 (1): 214-235.<br><br>
<span style="font-size:0.8em;">**Abstract:** We study the effect of property rights institutions in host countries, the institutions protecting investors from expropriation by host country agents, on the geographic structure and valuation of US multinational corporations (MNCs). We provide firm-level evidence that better property rights attract investment from MNCs. We disentangle the effects of the Stulz (2005) “twin agency problems” in the context of foreign direct investment and show that our results are not driven by legal institutions protecting investors from expropriation by corporate insiders. Further, we show that changes in the quality of property rights in locations where MNCs operate have material impact on MNCs’ valuations.</span>

2. [Foreign Investment, Regulatory Arbitrage, and the Risk of U.S. Banking Organizations](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-financial-and-quantitative-analysis/article/foreign-investment-regulatory-arbitrage-and-the-risk-of-us-banking-organizations/30086E27DD5CE2CA391597CEBAF6CA25) <br />
with Atanas Mihov and W. Scott Frame, Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, (2020) 55 (3): 955-988.<br><br>
<span style="font-size:0.8em;">**Abstract:** This study investigates the implications of cross-country differences in banking regulation and supervision for the international subsidiary locations and risk of U.S. bank holding companies (BHCs). We find that BHCs are more likely to operate subsidiaries in countries with weaker regulation and supervision and that such location decisions are associated with elevated BHC risk and higher contribution to systemic risk. The quality of BHCs’ internal controls and risk management plays an important role in these location choices and risk outcomes. Overall, our study suggests that U.S. banking organizations engage in cross-country regulatory arbitrage, with potentially adverse consequences.</span>

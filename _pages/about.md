I am a Finance Ph.D. Candidate at the Fisher College of Business, the Ohio State University. My research interests include financial intermediation and international finance. Before joining the Ohio State University, I was a Senior Quantitative Analyst in the Quantitative Supervision & Research group at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, where I contributed to the stress-testing program. I hold a B.A. in Economics and a B.S. in Mathematics from the University of Maryland, and an M.A. in Economics from the University of Texas at Austin.

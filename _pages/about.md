I am a finance Ph.D. student at the [Fisher College of Business](https://fisher.osu.edu), [the Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu). My research interests include financial intermediation, international finance, and empirical corporate finance. Prior to joining the Ohio State University, I was a Senior Quantitative Analyst in the [Quantitative Supervision & Research](https://www.richmondfed.org/banking/qsr) group at [the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond](https://www.richmondfed.org) where I contributed to the stress-testing program in the modeling and evaluation of credit risk and operational risk. I hold a B.A in Economics and a B.S. in Mathematics from [the University of Maryland](https://www.umd.edu) and a M.A. in Economics from [the University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/).

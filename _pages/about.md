I am a Finance Ph.D. Candidate at the Fisher College of Business, The Ohio State University. My job market paper aims to understand the impact of supply network fragility on firms' corporate policies.

My main research interests are corporate finance, financial intermediation, and international finance. 

Before joining The Ohio State University, I was a Senior Quantitative Analyst in the Quantitative Supervision & Research group at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, where I contributed to the stress-testing program. I hold a B.A. in Economics and a B.S. in Mathematics from the University of Maryland, and an M.A. in Economics from the University of Texas at Austin.
